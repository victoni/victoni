Hey there, I'm vict0ni.

I'm a penetration tester and a security researcher. I've went through the infosec journey, from CTFs to bug bounties and now working as an information security consultant, both as an employee and as a freelancer, collaborating with private and government organizations to secure their customer and citizen data.

## Content
